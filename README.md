## Fine-tuning LLMs with your own documents: An Introduction

This document offers an overview of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using your own documents, an essential component in retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

**What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?**

RAG allows LLMs to access and retrieve relevant information from an external dataset during their execution. This process is crucial for LLMs to be able to answer questions about specific documents, such as PDF files, videos, etc.

**The fine-tuning process involves:**

1. **Document loading:** Documents are loaded into the system, for example, by uploading PDF files.
2. **Splitting:** Documents are split into smaller chunks for efficient handling.
3. **Storage:** Chunks are stored in a vector database (vectorstore).
4. **Retrieval:** When a query is made, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks from the vector database.
5. **Output:** The retrieved chunks are used as context to generate an accurate and relevant response to the query.

**Tools:**

The document mentions tools like Langchain, OpenAI and PyPDFLoader to facilitate this process.

**Benefits:**

- It allows LLMs to access specific and updated information.
- Improves the accuracy and relevance of generated responses.
- Facilitates the adaptation of LLMs to specific domains or tasks.

This document serves as an introductory guide to understanding the fine-tuning of LLMs with your own documents and its importance in retrieval augmented generation.
